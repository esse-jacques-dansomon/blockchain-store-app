## Angular app

The Angular app is a simple NFT marketplace. It has a home page, a mint page, and a gallery page. The home page is the landing page. The mint page is where you can mint a new NFT. The gallery page is where you can see all the NFTs that have been minted.

The Angular app uses the ethers.js library to interact with the smart contract. The app uses the contract's ABI to create a contract object. The contract object is used to call the contract's functions and listen to the contract's events.


## Smart contract

The smart contract is a simple NFT contract. It has a mint function that allows anyone to mint a new NFT. The mint function takes a tokenURI as an argument. The tokenURI is a URL that points to the NFT's metadata. The mint function mints a new NFT and assigns the NFT to the caller.

The smart contract uses the OpenZeppelin ERC721 implementation. The ERC721 implementation is a standard for NFTs. It defines a set of functions and events that an NFT contract should have. The ERC721 implementation is a good starting point for creating an NFT contract.
